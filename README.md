## What Software Do I Need?
To edit/view this project, the following software requirements apply:

* You should have Python 3, NumPy, and pandas installed using Anaconda
* A text editor, like [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) or [Atom](https://atom.io/).
* A terminal application (Terminal on Mac and Linux or Git Bash on Windows).

## Usage
To use the bikeshare project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Make sure you have Python installed.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

4. Run the bikeshare.py file using the following command:

  `python bikeshare.py`

5. Follow the prompts to select a city (Chicago, New York City, or Washington) and specify filters for the data analysis.

6. The program will display various statistics and insights based on the selected city and filters.

_**Note:** The bikeshare project requires the following data files to be present in the project directory: chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv, and washington.csv. Make sure these files are included in the project folder before running the program._
